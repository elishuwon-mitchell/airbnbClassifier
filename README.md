# airbnbClassifier

This is a project for CS 378: Data Mining

The goal of this project was to implement a classification algorithm to classify which country a new Airbnb user is likely to visit for their first booking. Our main reason for wanting to explore this particular dataset was the desire to re-implement previous data mining tools and try to adapt their variants to the particular task. The two main approaches we explored were a classification-based approach for determining the country (class label) and a clustering-based approach to help fill in unknown values.
